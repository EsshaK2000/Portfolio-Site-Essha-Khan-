    <!--"Project Overview"-->
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <h3>What is Pet Vet?</h3>
        <p>Pet Vet is a veterinarian telemedicine application that connects pet owners with experienced veterinarians
        and provides easy access to veterinarian care-related information.
        <br>
        <br>
        Designed to enhance convenience and accessibility, the application provides concise profiles of
        independent veterinarians and operational animal clinics and hospitals, virtual appointments, service
        estimate inquiries, side-by-side prescription and treatment cost rates, and a file management tool.
        <br>
        <br>
        Pet Vet empowers pet owners to feel in financial control of their vet expenses while providing timely care
        for their cherished companions.

    <!--"Problem & Design Challenge"-->
    <h2>Problem and Design Challenge</h2>
    <h3>How might we design a solution that enhances accessibility and transparency of veterinarian care, while
        providing pet owners with reliable information and fostering trust?</h3>
        <p>
            Currently, pet owners have to manually research extensively through the internet to find information on
            veterinary practices including services, treatments, and reviews, leading to information overload and
            search fatigue.

    <!--"White Paper Research"-->
    <h2>White Paper Research</h2>
    <h3>3 in 5 Canadian pet owners believe their vet charged too much.</h3>
        <p>I used white paper research to better understand the problem space by discovering factual evidence on
        the relationship between the veterinarian industry and its consumers (pet owners). In return, this helped
        me define the scope of my problem statement and solutions.

            <p>I learned that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lacked cost transparency</li>
                    <li>Restricted access due to subscription-based models or required to commit to a specific hospital

                </ul>
            <p>Through analyzing the competition, I strategized how to position my solutions to address the critical gaps
            overlooked by competitors:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implementation of a transparent pricing model</li>
                    <li>Remphasize open access giving users the ability to book and complete virtual consultations easily
                    within the app.</li>
                    <li>Provide comprehensive veterinary information regarding independent/affiliated veterinarians
                    and clinics, including detailed profiles, reviews, and integrated contact information.</li>
                </ul>
     <!--"User Surveys"-->
    <h2>User Surveys</h2>
    <h3>I then reached out to 20 pet owners and had them complete my user survey.</h3>
            <p>Assessing pet owners' attitudes and behaviors towards the veterinarian care industry was particularly
            insightful as it shed light on their encounters, perceptions, expectations, and pain points when seeking
            veterinarian care for their pets.
            <br>
            <br>
            Through my survey research goals, I aimed to understand and:

    <!--"User Interviews"-->
        <h2>User Interviews</h2>
        <h3>Following the user survey results, I conducted in-depth user interviews with 3 pet owners.</h3>
            <p>While the survey had identified users' pain points, the interviews helped uncover the underlying context
            and reasoning behind them. The interviews offered a contextual understanding and insight into how users
            interact with veterinarian services in their day-to-day lives, shedding light on the real-life experiences and
            factors that influence their current perceptions and feelings.
            <br>
            <br>
            My user interview research goals included:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Investigate users' perceptions and emotional associations with veterinary care.</li>
                    <li>Explore how telemedicine applications fulfill users' functional needs, replacing physical methods
                    for routine tasks.</li>
                    <li>Assess participants' comfort level and familiarity with adopting digital veterinary telemedicine

    <!--"Main Conclusion"-->
        <h2>The Main Conclusion from User Surveys & User Interviews</h2>
        <h3>I found that despite pet owners' high regard for transparency in their pet's healthcare decision-making process, the
            veterinary industry is currently falling short in providing for this need.</h3>
            <p>
                These themes provide valuable insights into user perspectives and expectations regarding veterinary care,
                pointing to areas for improvement in communication, transparency, convenience, and organization within
                the veterinary industry and pet ownerâ€™s lifestyles.

    <!--"Persona"-->
        <h2>The Pet Owner Persona</h2>
        <h3>This is Aileen, our main pet owner persona.</h3>
            <p>Aileen is a representation of a specific subset of pet owners that emerged from the insights gathered
            through the user interviews and surveys conducted. Upon identifying the commonly shared pain points,
            needs, and behaviors of this subgroup, I created Aileen to categorize and encapsulate their expectations
            and requirements. Consequently, my design solutions and choices are rooted in the sentiments of this
            subgroup. This approach ensured that every design decision I made was grounded in Aileenâ€™s persona,
            leading to an effective product experience and user-centered outcome.
            </p>
    <!--"User Journey Mapping"-->
        <h2>User Journey Mapping</h2>
        <h3>Aileenâ€™s journey to finding a veterinarian for Luna. </h3>
            <p>Adopting a holistic approach, I mapped out Aileen's journey as she embarked on the search for
            veterinarian care, that aligns with her needs, goals, and motivations.
            <picture><!--"Aileen's User Journey Map Image"-->

            </picture>
            <br>
            <br>
            By mapping out the end to end process, I visualized and analyzed the complete user journey, identifying
            instances of friction and uncovering opportunities for my product to address these inefficiencies. This
            approach provided me with an understanding of how users would come across and interact with my
            product which in turn informed my solutions.
            </p>
    <!--"User Flows & IA"-->
        <h2>User Flows & Information Architecture</h2>
        <h3>Exploring user Flows and organizing structure.</h3>
            <p>
            The problem I aimed to address with the user flow design method was to ensure a seamless and effective
            user experience for pet owners seeking veterinary telemedicine services and information through my app.
            <picture><!--"User Journey Flow Image"-->
                <source srcset="img/petvet_media/project_page/information_architecture/PetVet_UserFlowDiagram@1x.jpg"  media="(max-width:767px)">

            </picture>
            <br>
            <br>
            I learned where users might encounter difficulties, such as searching for a suitable veterinarian or clinic for
            their pet or understanding how to initiate a teleconsultation. This made me more aware of more complex
            flows and solve how to effectively break them down into digestible processes.
            </p>
    <!--"Wireframing"-->
        <h2>Low fidelity to High Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        <h3>The blueprints of my design.</h3>
            <p>
            The low-fidelity and mid-fidelity wireframes served as a tangible foundation, allowing for rapid exploration
            of layout, content placement, and user flows. This iterative approach encouraged me to be creative when
            problem-solving complex user flows and identify potential design flaws at an early stage.
            <br>
            <br>
            The grey scale high fidelity wireframes served as the wireframes of the prototype to be used in my
            usability study. It is a semi-polished yet neutral representation of the design, allowing study participants to
            focus solely on layout, structure, and content hierarchy without the distraction of aesthetics. This
            approach ensures that design decisions are based on the fundamental visual elements and user
            experience, promoting better usability and functionality assessment.

                <ul>
                    <li>Participants began losing interest in the onboarding.</li>
                    <li>Improvement: I divided the onboarding process into smaller, more manageable screens to create
                    a step-by-step account setup experience. This approach aims to prevent users from feeling
                    overwhelmed by having to enter all their information at once.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>4/6 participants were unable to recollect their appointment booking details as they approached
                    the end of the booking process.</li>
                    <li>Improvement:I introduced a confirmation of booking details screen midway through the booking
                    process to ensure that users are informed and content with their selections made in the prior
                    booking screens.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>2/6 participants expressed that they would have liked to see an explanation of their selected
                    treatment. They expressed a preference for this information to be readily available within the
                    app, rather than having to resort to external sources like Google to understand its meaning.</li>
                    <li>Improvement: I added an additional screen that explains the treatmentâ€™s purpose and how itâ€™s
                    performed.</li>
